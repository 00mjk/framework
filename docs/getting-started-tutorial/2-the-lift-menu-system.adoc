# The Lift Menu System

Another distinguishing characteristic of Lift is that it is *secure by
default*. Amongst other things, this means that you can't access a file in your
`src/main/webapp` directory through your application unless you explicitly
define that it's meant to be accessed. You define this using Lift's menu
system, called `SiteMap`.

Hooking up a simple page like this one is easy, and seems redundant; rest
assured, we'll explore the real power of `SiteMap` as the application becomes
more complicated. All you have to do for the chat page is add a line to your
`SiteMap.scala` that names the page and points to the file in the `webapp`
directory:

```
...
    Menu.i("Chat") / "chat"
...
```

The string passed to `i` is the name of this menu. We can use that to
[automatically render links for our menu](#section-12). It gets processed
through Lift's internationalization system, but since we've got no
internationalization set up for now it'll just go through unchanged. The part
after the `/` specifies where the template will be foundâ€”in our case, in the
`chat.html` file directly under `src/main/webapp`.

With that out of the way, we can move on to bringing our HTML to life.
